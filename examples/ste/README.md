# Simple Technical English Linearizer

This example was built during the first NLG hackathon at INLG'16.

It takes Stanford dependency parse trees and linearizes them.

To run it:

```bash
composer install
php example.php
php example.php sentence.deps
```


See https://github.com/DrDub/SimpleTechnicalEnglishCompressor for a
demo, where the Stanford dependencies are pruned to obtain simplified
text.
